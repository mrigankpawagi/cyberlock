<h3>What is Mobile Theft ?</h3><br />
<p align="justify">
Technology is allowing us to do more and more things through our phones – from shopping to banking to social media – as well as making calls and sending texts. Not only are our phones more valuable in themselves, but many of them will also contain valuable data, whether that's downloaded music and films, the photographs you have taken, or other personal information. As a result, mobile phones can be a very tempting target for thieves, with the loss of a phone causing great inconvenience to the user.
<br /><br />
However, there are some simple steps that you can take to protect your mobile phone against theft including:
<br /><br />
1. Use the security features provided<br />
2. Be aware of your surroundings<br />
3. Know how to identify it when the phone is stolen<br />
4. If your phone is stolen or lost, you should report it to your operator and police by telling them your MANUFACTURER, MODEL, IMEI number, color, some special recognizable details (if any), place and date where it was stolen and some other circumstances that could help them to find or locate your mobile phone.<br /><br/>
